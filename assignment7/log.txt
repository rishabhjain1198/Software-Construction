The system I would be trying to access is also owned by me in this lab session.
 I loaded two different operating systems on two different machines by 
booting up Ubuntu from flash disks. Since root access is required for the 
commands I'm about to execute, using SEASNet lab machines will not be 
optimal.

First we have to check whether we have openssh installed correctly or not:

dpkg --get-selections | grep openssh

Seeing that everything is in order, including the openssh-server module,
I proceed forward to start the server for the other machine to access:

ssh-keygen

This is done to generate and authenticate RSA keys for whenever someone tries
to SSH into the machine I's host. At first, I don't set any password for
this key.

sudo useradd -d /home/machine2/ -m machine2

This created added a user to the operating system with username machine2
and also created a directory machine2 within home.

sudo passwd machine2

This command is used to set the password for the user machine2. Now I change
into machine2's user directory.

cd /home/machine2

Now I have to create an SSH directory to store the information from the 
RSA keys (public and private) to the hosts. It is important to make sure
machine2 is the owner of the newly created files since machine2 should be
allowed to log in and create new files as they please.

sudo mkdir .ssh
sudo chown -R machine2 .ssh
sudo chmod 700 .ssh

By using ifconfig, I found the ip address of my own machine:

192.232.112.73

Now I switch to machine2 and try to login as a client for machine1.

ssh-copy-id -i machine2@192.232.112.73

This adds machine2's public key to the ssh folder which we had created
earlier.

ssh-add 

This command alsong with ssh-agent saves the password required to log into
the server in the ssh folder. Thus, the identity of the user is verified
on the basis of the RSA keys and machine2 won't have to type the password
in every single time they log in.

ssh machine2@192.232.112.73

I've successfully logged into machine1. Now I try to create a file and see
if that is noticable on machine1's interface.

touch hello_world.txt

By using ls on machine1's terminal, I could see that hello_world.txt was
successfully created.

Now I try to log in with the capability to open other programs.

ssh -X machine2@192.232.112.73

Login was successful, and now I try to open Firefox.

firefox

Sure enough, firefox opens up.
