I checkout a branch of the v3.0 diffutils by:
git checkout v3.0 -b quote

Now I apply the patch that I generated in the lab:
patch -p1 < ../quote-3.0-patch.txt

After doing git status, I can see that the required .c files were
successfully modified. I open them one by one in emacs and use
C-x 4 a to create changelogs for all of the files.

I add all the newly changed files and commit the changes:

git add .
git commit -F Changelog

I generate a formatted patch by using:
git format-patch -1 —stdout > formatted-patch.txt

I try this patch out by checking out another branch of v3.0:

git checkout v3.0 -b tester

git am < ../formatted-patch.txt

Now I run the commands specified in the README to build the executable:
./bootstrap
./configure
make
make check
make distdir

This creates a new directory that contains a version of diffutils based on
the formatted patch we had earlier created. We can view the changelog using 
git log, and see that the changes are the same as we had done using emacs
earlier.

gitk was not installed in the SEASnet machine, so I decided
to try it out on my local machine.

I logout of SEASnet and clone a copy of the emacs source 
repo into my local machine to run gitk on:

git clone https://git.savannah.gnu.org/git/emacs.git

I change directory into it:

cd emacs

After installing gitk by updating git on my machine, I run gitk 
in this directory:

gitk

A window opens showing me all sorts of details about git related
to this directory. I scroll through the merge dates until I get to one
which is the newest, but not newer than 2015-01-25.

The merge was made by Barry O’Reilly on 2013-10-19 and the
file src/eval.c was modified to fix iteration over specpdl stack.
