Starting from the top left and going in clockwise direction:

There is a windows which shows all the commits and merges in
a tree structure. We can view all the different branches, along
with the commit messages which were provided when the commits 
were presumably made.

There is a parallel list of authors which indicates who made 
which commit. Their email is also provided.

Another window contains the exact date and time when the parallel
commit was made.

The largest window shows all the files which were affected by the 
highlighted commit.

The final window shows all the details about the highlighted commit.
It shows us the exact changes made to each file in diff format,
along with information about the person who made the 
commit (name and email), as well as showing us all the children
and branches of this commit. The changelog is also available to
inspect. We can also see the SHA1 ID of the selected commit.
