File - sfrob.txt - A file to describe the results of running the time command
on sfrob and sfrobu (buffered and unbuffered programs respectively) and sfrobs
to note the time differences.

We write the line "Hello my name is Jahan." for varying powers of 10 and time it
and run it with the three versions of sfrob - namely sfrob, sfrobu, sfrobs.
The results are as shown below:

There are many key things to note about these timings, with the most important
being the sys times. We notice that in all cases between sfrob and sfrobu, 
sfrob has a lower sys time because it spends less time in kernel mode due it
requiring fewer syscalls. The other times seem to be in favour of sfrobu but
the results are not indicative of the performance with respect to syscalls, and
maybe lower because less time is spent in user mode in sfrobu as it switches to
Kernel mode more often for the higher number of syscalls. But we notices that
the real times are around the same for both versions.

We notice the shell script sfrobs has slower real times (execution times) than
both sfrob and sfrobu because, its running in bash which is an interpreted
language (slower) and the piping results in the program taking slightly more time
to execute commands through continuous streams of input and output.

In terms of the relationship between sfrobu's number of comparisons and the
number of input lines we observe the following relationship:

Num of Lines	Num of Comparisons
10				173
100				2902
1000			40392
10000			519571
100000			6387388

Graphing this we find a linear relationship between the number of lines and
the number of comparisons. Using the phrase "Hello my name is Jahan." gave us 
the following relationship:
number of comparisons = 64.141*(number of lines)
The linear regression coefficent R^2= 0.99968 which agrees with the linear
relationship.
