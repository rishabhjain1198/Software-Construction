After noticing the issue with th ls command in coreutils 7.6, we begin to 
patch the issue up. We do this by cd'ing back into coreutils-7.6
directory and creating a file called patch_file with the copied and
pasted text from Brady's patch. We then run the following command within
the current directory:
patch -p1 < patch_file

And we then finally run the make command. Now we see that the ls command in
the coreutils-7.6/src/ directory follows the behaviour of displaying the
timestamp Month-Date-Year/Hour instead of Year-Month-Date.

In the output we get from running make after applying the
patch, we notice that there are much fewer files being
compiled again as compared to the original make command. We see fewer
leaving/entering commands.

The make all-recursive command checks through all the relevant directories
within the coreutils-7.6 (where we applied the patch) to see if based on the
Makefile there was any change in the relevant source files after the patch
and finds that the only change to make was in the src folder.

What we essentially did after applying the patch was to recompile only the
selected files that had been modified from the original.Note that we only make
the patch and not install it because this way we have the broken version of ls
in the coretutilsInstall/bin folder and the fixed version in the coreutils-7.6/src
folder.

We are then able to test the result out on the fixed and broken versions as
follows:
touch -t 8901241220 old
touch new
