1.) The line is repeated twice and there is a goto statement in a switch statement. Because it is part of a switch  statement, it was not necessary to remove it.

2.) The new patched version of the coreutils-7.6 assumes the reader is
accustomed to reading the date in English, which may not be the case if my
company was to be working with international clients/colleagues and so may
create an aura of confusion due to the timestamp format. 

3.) 
File "/usr/local/cs/Python-2.7.10/lib/python2.7/random.py", line 275, in choice
    return seq[int(self.random() * len(seq))]  # raises IndexError if seq is 
    empty
    IndexError: list index out of range
Because the seq is empty we get the index error.

4.) Python3 deprecated automatic tuple unpacking, and so the parameter
(errno, strerror) passed in an exception gives an error as this is a tuple.
  File "randline.py", line 65
    except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
